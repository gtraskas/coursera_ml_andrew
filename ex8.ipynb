While the servers were operating, $m = 307$ examples of how they were behaving were collected, and thus having an unlabeled dataset $\\left\\{x^{(1)},\\dots,x^{(m)}\\right\\}$. It is suspected that the vast majority of these examples are \"normal\" (non-anomalous) examples of the servers operating normally, but there might also be some examples of servers acting anomalously within this dataset.\n",

On that dataset a Gaussian distribution will be fitted in order to find values that have very low probability and hence can be considered anomalies. After that, the anomaly detection algorithm will be applied to a larger dataset with many dimensions."

To come up with a vectorized implementation, the following tip is helpful: The $R$ matrix can be used to set selected entries to 0. For example, $R * M$ will do an element-wise multiplication between $M$ and $R$; since $R$ only has elements with values either 0 or 1, this has the effect of setting the elements of $M$ to 0 only when the corresponding value in $R$ is 0. Hence, `np.sum(error * R)` is the sum of all the elements of $M$ for which the corresponding element in $R$ equals 1.\n",
